                <p>Some may call my work and personal history intriguing while others may refer to it as bizarre.  I belive it is somewhere in the middle.  Here's some fun history for you to better understand where I come from, who I am, and how my unique background got me where I am today.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Childhood</b><br>Grew up moving up and down the west coast of the United States, finally settled in Portland, Oregon.</li>
                    <li><b>The Teenage years</b><br>In high school I was certain I would be a doctor or a teacher.  My favorite subject was AP Biology.  I was Captain of the Dance Team (in my case this sport was for the nerds of the school).  I developed a back injury in my Senior Year and learned I have an extra vertebrae.  How's that for a random fact!  Throughout high school I enjoyed many jobs such as babysitting, catering, ice cream scooper, and more!</li>
                    <li><b>University...6 Beautiful Years</b><br>I attended Oregon State University beginning with a major in Nutrition and a minor in Spanish - intention was to move on to medical school (there was no pre-med major available).  I changed courses after a couple of years, switching my major to Early Childhood Education.  Afer studying abroad in Spain and finishing the requirements for my minor I realized I didn't feel confident in my Spanish knowledge and decided to pursue a second degree in Spanish to further hone my skills.  One requirement for this Spanish degree was to take a couple years of an additional language - in my case, italiano.  I was fortunate enough to have a second study abroad experience in Italy where I fell in love with the people, culture, and let's not kid ourselves, the food of this beautiful part of the world.  Ultimately I graduated with a B.A. in Spanish and a B.S. in Humand Development & Family Sciences (focus on Early Childhood Education).  My Friday nights in college were spent babysitting and completing homework - I was so much fun!</li>
                    <li><b>A Passion is Born <i>(who knew it would shape my future)</i></b><br>During college I was also able to take PADI SCUBA certification as an elective.  I was invited to spend 10 days in Belize the following summer and BOOM another passion was born.</li>
                    <li><b>Young Adulthood</b><br>After graduating I realized that spending all of my working hours with children would quickly burn me out and make it more difficult to enjoy my future children.  After a brief stint as a nanny on the east coast I decided to switch gears and switch to Conference Management / hotel & hospitality work.</li>
                    <li><b>Ciao!</b><br>During a business trip to Reno I met a woman from Italy who is now a dear friend.  I explained to her that my life's dream was to become Italian.  She invited me to come live with her and her boyfriend in Bologna, Italy while I searched for work.  I bought a one way ticket and lived in their pantry while traveling the country and interviewing at hotels.  Ultimately I decided the US was my home and I returned in time to help my nephew get ready for halloween as Captain Jack Sparrow.  Aaaaaahhhh those were good times.</li>
                    <li><b>Back to My Roots</b><br>Upon my return to the US I decided to return to my roots and begin working for Early Head Start.  I will leave out the gory details but after some incredible years with this work I switched gears when I found an opening for an 80% travel position for a wind turbine manufacturer.</li>
                    <li><b>The Corporate World</b><br>After 11.5 years with this company and seeing parts of the world I never would have seen without this opportunity, it was time (way past time?) to part ways with the corporate world.  I had realized that I had knack for ERP systems and quickly became a superuser.  During this time I also honed my skills in customer service, learned a touch about engineering, and most importantly had children.</li>
                    <li><b>The Best of Belize</b><br>The next big adventure was starting my own business and working as a contractor doing reservations for a resort in Belize.  Who knew that this would be a perfect culmination of my skills.  But alas, the reactive nature of the work was wearing on me and my work-life balance so I thought...I have loved dabbling in html, why not give it a try!</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>And alas... I found Treehouse Tech Degree program.  After years of a dear friend encouraging me to pursue the tech industry I finally started on this path.  I couldn't be happier or more excited about the skills I am learning.  My hope is to use my abundance (if not random) of experience with technical skills, customer service, communication, marketing, and more to be a contractor in the tech world.  If I'm being perfectly honest I have an other passion - data.  So hopefully data science is also in my future, once I master Front End Web design.  There you have it - more information than you would have asked for or expected.  Looking forward to the opportunity to put my new and old skills to use!</p>
